# UCD-Dance-Team-Website
Creating a website with html, css, and js modeled after UCD Athletics pages.
UCDDT is not actually a part of Athletics, but I mainly made this to learn how to create a website from scratch and chose to model it off of Athletics and see if I could replicate the style to fit the branding. I even made the UC Davis Dance Team image with the Athletics 'Invader' font using an image editor and cutting and pasting the letters together. I was inspired to make this because our current webpage on the Campus Recreation site is very outdated. Performances page was made by me, others bring you to existing links.

Used the first 40 minutes of this tutorial, but added a lot of my own ideas/features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FazgJVnrVuI&t=2059s
