# UCD-Dance-Team-Website
Creating a website with html, css, and javascript modeled after UCD Athletics pages, specifically UCD Cheer Team. 
UCDDT is not actually a part of Athletics, but I mainly made this to learn how to create a website from scratch and chose to model it off of Athletics and see if I could replicate the style to fit the branding. I even made the UC Davis Dance Team image with the Athletics 'Invader' font using an image editor and cutting and pasting the letters together. I was inspired to make this because our current webpage on the Campus Recreation site is very outdated. 

Used this tutorial, but added a lot of my own ideas/features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FazgJVnrVuI&t=2059s
